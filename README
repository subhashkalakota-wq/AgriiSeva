## 📌 Project Overview
The Agriculture Guidance System is a mobile application designed to assist farmers in selecting and managing crops based on climate conditions, land size, and seasonal patterns.  
The system provides complete crop lifecycle guidance with voice support in Telugu and English to support rural and uneducated farmers.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Farmers lack timely climate-based guidance for crop selection, pest control, and resource planning, leading to low productivity and financial losses.  
There is a need for a voice-enabled smart agriculture application that provides end-to-end crop lifecycle support, land-based input calculations, and insect management in local languages.
